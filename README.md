# Vulnerability Assessment Tool

## Overview

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool is a desktop application built using Python and Tkinter, designed for performing network vulnerability scans using Nmap and searching for vulnerabilities based on service names and versions using the Google Custom Search API. The tool provides users with a simple and intuitive graphical interface to input target IPs, select scan types, and view results, including potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

- Perform various types of Nmap scans (Fast, Basic, Full TCP, and Full TCP/UDP).
- Lookup vulnerabilities based on service names and versions using the Google Custom Search API.
- Save scan reports in both text and PDF formats.
- Multi-threaded scanning to prevent freezing the GUI during operations.
